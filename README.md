**📌 Project Overview**

This project transforms raw gym management data into a 6-page strategic dashboard. The goal was to identify why revenue was declining despite high member loyalty and to uncover hidden operational risks in staffing and equipment maintenance.

**🛠 Tech Stack**

Data Extraction: SQL (Complex Joins & Aggregations)

Visualization: Power BI

Analysis: Business Intelligence & Financial Modeling

**🚀 Key Business Insights**
1. The "Found Money" Strategy (Revenue Growth)
_Discovery_: Identified 74 highly engaged Day Pass members contributing only €928/month.

_Impact_: Proposed a targeted upgrade campaign to Premium tiers, unlocking an 81% revenue increase (€3,882/month) from this segment alone.

2. The Payroll Crisis (Profitability)
_Discovery_: Coach payroll consumes 64% of total revenue, vastly exceeding the 40% industry benchmark.

3. With classes only 51% full, the gym is paying fixed costs for "empty rooms."

_Recommendation_: Transition to a Variable Pay Model (Base + Per-Head Bonus) to align labor costs with attendance.

4. The 9-Year Maintenance "Time Bomb" (Risk Management)
_Discovery_: 100% of active equipment is overdue for service, with some assets in the high-traffic Functional Zone neglected for over 3,300 days.

_Risk_: High liability and potential for catastrophic failure of a €914K asset base.

**💻 SQL: The "Under the Hood" Logic**

I used SQL to clean and validate the data before visualization. For example, calculating the net profit per session required joining multiple tables (Staffing, Attendance, and Membership) to expose the -€4,000 monthly loss in Functional Training.

**Database Schema**

The database `GymAnalysis` contains 6 tables in a star-like relational structure:
```
members ──────────── attendance ──────── coaches
   │                                        │
   └──────────── payments          group\_classes
                                        │
                                   equipment
```
